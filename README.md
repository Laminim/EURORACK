# ST MODULAR
_EURORACK DIY_

This repository was made to provide you with the neccessary information to source your parts and find their place on the PCB. There wonÂ´t be full build documentations available at any time in the future. 

If you have questions before or while building please join the [ST Modular Builders Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/stmodular/) on Facebook. There you will also find additional information about the builds in the "units" section.

I also recommend to fully read the "Eurorack Soldering Guide" available above. It includes a step-by-step description how I solder DIY projects, a list of recommended soldering tools and some links that might be useful when jumping into Eurorack DIY.

All modules were developed as part of a hobby. All the knowledge of electronics and circuit board construction required to realise such projects was acquired through reading books, breadboarding and talking to other synthesiser hobbyists.

ST Modular itself does not sell products, but grants distribution licenses to third parties. In addition to selling PCBs, Panels and DIY kits, some partners of ST Modular also offer prefabricated modules. The availability of the PCBs and modules is solely in the hands of the dealers.

There are no PDF user manuals available for the modules. Functional descriptions and further details can be found on the respective module website. If there are any further questions, don't hesitate to ask in the ST Modular Builders Group on Facebook.
 
If you intend to build an ST MODULAR module, you should be able to solder components in the 0603 package. The PCBs are not necessarily designed to be easy to build, but are described by many builders as self-explanatory and intuitive to solder. Nevertheless, it is recommended that ST modular PCBs are only assembled by experienced builders.
 
The successful assembly, the safe power supply and the necessary calibration of the module are exclusively your responsibility. You are solely responsible for ensuring that the finished module does not damage other devices to which you connect it. You are responsible for any damage to other equipment. ST Modular is  not responsible if you injure yourself or others or damage your property or the property of others while building or using the circuit boards provided. No PCBs, complete kits or assembled modules will be available through st-modular.com in the future and no repairs will be offered or carried out.
